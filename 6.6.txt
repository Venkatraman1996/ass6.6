1. Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler
Fifo scheduler:
The FIFO Scheduler places applications in a queue and runs them in the order of
submission (first in, first out). a small file has to wait until the large file preceding it
in the queue to execute first.
Capacity scheduler:
With the Capacity Scheduler, a separate dedicated queue allows the small job to
start as soon as it is submitted. Large job finishes late when compared with using the FIFO
Scheduler.

2. What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x:
*In hadoop 1.x all the operations such as utilization and job monitoring are monitored by job
tracker where as in 2.x this is handeled by splitting the task to resource manager,node manager
and the application manager.
*the number nodes that can be fit into the cluster has been scaled up from 4000 to 10000.
*hadoop 2.x also support other processing models other than map reduce model
*in hadoop 2.x resource allocation nis dyanamic
